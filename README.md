# Restaurant Review App

This repository is the [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1) for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree program I am enrolled in. The [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1090/view) has three main criteria: a responsice design, accessibility, and offline availability.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone this repo.

2. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.

## Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
